# AthletiCore — Smart Sports Performance & Injury Prevention Platform

## Project Overview
AthletiCore is a backend-driven full stack sports analytics platform designed to help athletes, coaches, and teams make data-driven training decisions.

The system tracks player workload, performance metrics, and recovery indicators to proactively identify injury risks and recommend optimized training plans.

This platform acts as a **Decision Support System** for sports teams by transforming raw performance data into actionable insights.

---

## Problem Statement
Most college and amateur sports teams lack structured systems to monitor athlete performance and fatigue levels. Overtraining and poor workload management often result in preventable injuries.

AthletiCore solves this by providing:

- Centralized performance tracking  
- Intelligent workload analysis  
- Injury risk prediction  
- Smart training recommendations  
- Team-level analytics  

---

## Key Features

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The system supports multiple user roles:

- Athlete → Logs training and views insights  
- Coach → Monitors players and manages training  
- Team Admin → Manages teams and system access  

This ensures secure and structured data access.

---

### Performance Tracking Engine
Athletes can log:

- Distance covered  
- Sprint speed  
- Heart rate  
- Training load  
- Match statistics  
- Sleep & recovery data  

The system maintains historical records to enable trend analysis.

---

### Injury Risk Prediction
AthletiCore evaluates injury probability using workload and recovery indicators.

Example factors:

- Sudden spike in training intensity  
- High fatigue levels  
- Insufficient recovery  
- Excessive weekly load  

The architecture is designed to later integrate Machine Learning models for predictive analytics.

---

### Smart Training Recommendation Engine
Based on athlete workload, the system suggests:

- Recovery sessions  
- Light training days  
- High-intensity workouts  
- Rest periods  

This helps prevent burnout and optimize performance.

---

### Team Management
Coaches and admins can:

- Create teams  
- Add/remove players  
- Compare athlete performance  
- View team analytics dashboards  

---

## System Architecture
The backend follows a **Layered Architecture** to ensure scalability and maintainability.


### Principles Used:
- Encapsulation  
- Abstraction  
- Separation of Concerns  
- SOLID principles  

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React.js  
- Tailwind / CSS  

### Backend (Primary Focus)
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- MongoDB  
- JWT Authentication  

### Future Enhancements
- Machine Learning injury prediction microservice  
- Wearable device integrations  
- Real-time performance tracking  
- Advanced analytics dashboards  

---

## Expected Learning Outcomes
- Real-world system design  
- Backend architecture patterns  
- Database modeling  
- Secure authentication  
- Role-based authorization  
- Scalable API design  

---

## Project Scope
AthletiCore is designed to evolve throughout the semester from a structured backend system into an intelligent sports analytics platform capable of supporting competitive teams.
